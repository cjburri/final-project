# Unify
Danya Barron, Connor Burri, Molly Wirtz

Unify is a Spotify comparison app, which takes in two Spotify user IDs and returns the songs in common between the users. Also provided are some additional data analysis, such as top albums in common, and a real-time global chat functionality.

To use this application, first login to spotify using the Login button on the first page. You will be prompted in a new tab to sign in with Spotify, after which you can close the window. If you do not have a personal spotify account, we have created one to test with: 

Username: 
Password: 
User ID: 

You may also use our personal Spotify IDs to test with:

A few things to note when using this application: 
- Please enter the Spotify USER ID for this app to function correctly. This is different than the screen name that is displayed, and is often an alphanumeric string. This ID can be located in your Spotify Account Overview page under Username.

- Unfortunately, due to time constraints, this application does not gracefully handle server-side errors. Failure to load the content on form submission may be due to an incorrect User ID or a timeout connection to Spotify API.

- Probably other things I can't think of rn

### Technologies
Unify uses React and Bootstrap on the frontend, with a Node backend. Various libraries were leveraged to assist us.
